This is combined macro/layout set of tools for printing 
envelopes using the 32 bit version of Describe 3 under
OS/2 2.0. It may work with other versions 
of Describe as well, but has not been tested. The following 
files are Describe documents and should be edited or viewed 
only with Describe. Additional information is contained in 
ENVELOPE.DOC:

ENVELOPE.DOC	Documentation file
ENVELOPE.LAY	Layout file used for printing envelopes
ENVELOPE.MAC	The main envelope macro


If you want to distribute this macro solution to others, 
make certain that the preceding three files are included in 
whatever you send.
